# Modding

Modding is pretty simple, anything that works in Psych Engine will work in this, as this mod uses Psych as the base.

Do not that if a mod relies on base game assets, it will not work.

A little bit of a difference from Psych Engine, this mod automatically detects and plays dialogue.

`dialogue.json` plays before song, `after.json` plays after!
